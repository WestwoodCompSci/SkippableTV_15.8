Walt and Jesse come to an agreement: Walt will cook the meth while Jesse sells it. He eventually discovers Walt's purpose in collaborating with him. Meanwhile, Hank ties the recovered respirator back to the high school chemistry lab and investigates further. After discovering the start of a hair loss, Walt shaves his head. When the initial batch of meth only yields $2,600, Walt demands that Jesse find a new distributor to fund his medical expenses. Jesse gets connected to Tuco, the drug dealer who replaced Krazy-8. However, when Jesse goes to make a deal, Tuco severely beats him and steals the meth. Walt returns and causes an explosion in Tuco's hideout. Tuco then decides to deal with Walt.
