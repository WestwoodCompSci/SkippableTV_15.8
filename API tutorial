Tutorial for creating API through eclipse

Before a method, insert a block comment with 2 asterisks (*)
Example:
/**This is how you describe the subsequent field or method
* /
public int myInteger;

/**This is a method that is an example for API creation (this is the description)
* anything with the '@' tag can be used to specify certain things about the method 
* @param paramA - description of paramA
* @param paramB - paramB is the second example parameter
* @throws IllegalArgumentException - describe why it is thrown
* @throws IOException - again,describe...
* @return The method returns an integer that means... 
* */
public int myMethod(int paramA,String paramB){
	//Possible IllegalArgumentException thrown from this method, so use @throws to note it
}	 

After all the methods and classes are documented:
goto the toolbar
Project->generate Javadocs
	if needed, for Javadoc Command, select yourJDKFolder/bin/javadoc.exe

Refer to NetworkCLient.java for a complete example.
Documenting is actually alot of work!
